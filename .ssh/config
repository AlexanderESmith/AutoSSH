# Example ssh config file

# These servers all have a specific prefix that
#	we can apply the ProxyCommand to in the next
#	section
# They use the private IP addresses that are
#	assigned within the publiclly inaccessible
#	network you're connecting to (not public IPs)
host someprefix-server-1
	hostname 10.0.1.1
host someprefix-server-2
	hostname 10.0.1.2
	user hostspecificuser
	identityfile ~/.ssh/hostspecificuser_key.pem
host someprefix-serverindns-1
host someprefix-serverindns-2
host someprefix-serverindns-3
# The next host has a specific name in your network
#	or DNS, but we're adding our prefix so we
#	can apply the ProxyCommand to it, like the
#	others
host someprefix-specificallynamedserver
	hostname specificallynamedserver

# This section applies to all servers with the prefix
#	and uses the jumpbox to connect to them
host someprefix-*
#	Apply a domain to a hostname to create a FQDN
#	hostname %h.somedomain.com
	ProxyCommand ssh -q -W %h:%p jumpbox
	user someotheruser
	identityfile ~/.ssh/someotheruser_key.pem

# This defines the server on the edge of the dmz
host jumpbox
	ProxyCommand ssh -q -W %h:%p somejumpserver
	user someuser
